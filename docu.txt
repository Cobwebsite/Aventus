For the doc we need :

- Display all the data - maybe join with C#
- Display the basics components (input, btn, etc)
	- css variables (--internal or --_)
	- properties, attributes, watches, slots (how to documents slots?)
	- display the methods
	- display diffents examples that can be named
- Display all the communications (ws and http) - maybe join with C#
	- Display the request and the response
	- Maybe add a custom body to test it like swagger
- Display the rams?

Do we need to merge with parent doc?
